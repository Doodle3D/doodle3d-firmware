# TODO
- licensing (also for hardware and firmware) + credits
  http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/04/pick-a-license-any-license.html
- add more config options to package; candidates:
  reconf.WWW_RENAME_NAME, wifihelper.{AP_ADDRESS, AP_NETMASK, (NET)}
  about bridging this to lua: have some Makefile stage create a ini/lua file with k/v's and have lua read out that file?
  https://github.com/2ion/ini.lua
- write a shellscript to automate tasks like swapping out /www and packaging modified code for git merging
- see if updating works when a new version is 'released' (probably needs a real feed)
- perhaps opkg+safeboot could be useful in the update mechanism?
- add aliases to root profile only when debugging was requested in menuconfig
- add config option to compile sources using luac?
- add dependency on either wr703n or mr3020 (and probably comment it out to avoid being to conservative...)
- add/link general OpenWrt build instructions for OSX to installation page on wiki.
- relocatabilty of package (take root prefix into consideration everywhere)


# TODO for autowifi.js
- escape text where necessary (e.g. in getKnown, '<unknown SSID>' is currently interpreted as html...)
- why is $.trim() required in string comparison? do we need to strip newlines in the parse functions?
- add hidden field in html to remember encryption (so we know whether or not a passphrase should be entered)
- instead of showing alerts on missing ssid/phrase in connect, disable the button until contraints have been satisfied
  (this is also cleaner in case no networks are present)
- use json for communication?

# Shelled bugs/annoyances (all except the lua errors have been filed)
+ scripts are only allowed to be created in src folder? (nothing else shown, root greys out 'Finish')
+ text inside heredoc is highlighted
+ only one space allowed at start of line...makes it impossible to draw ascii art
  plus: I think it breaks my spaces/tabs occasionally but that could have been something else
- errors after creating new script file (mentioning lua...maybe a conflict?)
