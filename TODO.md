# TODO (new functionality)
 - fix init script handling as described here: http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/packages#packaging.a.service
 - implement (automated) test code where possible
   * in 'test' dir next to 'src', with API tests under 'test/www/'
   * www tests check functionality of the test module
   * www tests also provide an interface to run arbitrary get/post requests
   * test path splitting as well
 - document REST API
   * fail/error difference: fail is a valid rq aka 'could not comply', while error is invalid rq _or_ system error
   * modules/functions prefixed with '_' are for internal use
   * rq IDs and endpoint information can be supplied (but it's probably not useful after all)
   * list endpoints+args+CRUD type
   * success/fail/error statuses are justified by drupal api
   * unknown values (e.g. in network info) are either empty or unmentioned fields
 - define a list of REST error codes to be more descriptive for clients (e.g. errortype=system/missing-arg/generic)
 - steps to take regarding versioning/updating
   * versioning scheme
   * create feed location (e.g. www.doodle3d.com/firmware/packages) (see here: http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/packages#third.party.packages)
   * create opkg (already present in bin/ar71xx/packages as .ipk file)
   * create listing info for package list (checksum, size, etc. ...is this inside the .ipk file?)
   * find a way to add the feed url to opkg.conf (directly in files during image building?)
   * determine how opkg decides what is 'upgradeable'
   * at this point manual updating should be possible, now find out how to implement in lua (execve? or write a minimalistic binding to libopkg?)
   * expose through info API and/or system API; also provide a way (future) to flash a new image
 - generally, for configuration keys, it could be a good idea to use the concept of default values so it's always possible to return to a 'sane default config'
   * use a uci wifibox config to store configuration and a uci wifibox-defaults config as fallback-lookup (which contains a complete default configuration)
   * specify min/max/type/regex for each config key in separate lua file
   * perhaps defaults should be specified together with min/max/type/regex
 - dynamic AP name based on partial MAC (present in default config so it can be overridden and reverted again)
 - require api functions which change state to be invoked as post request
  * can this be modelled like java annotations or c function attributes?
  * otherwise maybe pair each function with <func>_attribs = {â€¦}?
 - add API functions to test network connectivity in steps (any chance(e.g. ~ap)? ifup? hasip? resolve? ping?) to network or test
 - handling requests which need a restart of uhttpd (e.g. network/openap) will probably respond with some kind of 'please check back in a few seconds' response
 - add more config options to package, which should act as defaults for a config file on the system; candidates:  
   reconf.WWW_RENAME_NAME, wifihelper.{AP_ADDRESS, AP_NETMASK, (NET)}

# Ideas / issues to work out
 - add system api module? for check-updates/do-update/etc
 - licensing (also for hardware and firmware) + credits for external code and used ideas (<http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/04/pick-a-license-any-license.html>)
 - (this is an old todo item from network:available(), might still be relevant at some point)
   extend netconf interface to support function arguments (as tables) so wifihelper functionality can be integrated
   but how? idea: pass x_args={arg1="a",arg2="2342"} for component 'x'
   or: allow alternative for x="y" --> x={action="y", arg1="a", arg2="2342"}
   in any case, arguments should be put in a new table to pass to the function (since order is undefined it must be an assoc array)
 - perhaps opkg+safeboot could be useful in the update mechanism?
 - add config option to compile sources using luac _or_ add an option to minify the lua code


# Bugs
 - in captive portal mode, https is not redirected
 - using iwinfo with interface name 'radio0' yields very little 'info' output while wlan0 works fine.
   However, sometimes wlan0 disappears (happened after trying to associate with non-existing network)...why?
 - protect dump function against reference loops (see <http://lua-users.org/wiki/TableSerialization>, json also handles this well)
 - relocatabilty of package (take root prefix into consideration everywhere)
