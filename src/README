Installation:
- place the src directory in /usr/share/lua and name it 'autowifi'
- create a symlink to ext/wfcf in /www/cgi-bin (make sure the file is executable)
- create a symlink to admin in /www
- create a symlink to ext/autowifi_init in /etc/rc.d and name it S18autowifi_init
- (not necessary) enable init script by calling it with 'enable' argument?
- make sure radio0 in /etc/config/wireless is not disabled
- the wlan net must also be added to firewall in the lan zone

== these two items are now handled by the script
- create a wlan network in /etc/config/network as follows <<EOF
config interface 'wlan'
	option ifname 'radio0'
	option proto 'dhcp'
EOF
  NOTE: apparently it should have no ifname (network reload will complain about an unsupported operation)
- HOWEVER in ap mode it should be static with address '192.168.10.1' and netmask '255.255.255.0'
  AND act as dhcp server, add to /etc/config/dhcp <<EOF
config dhcp 'wlan'
	option interface 'wlan0'
	option start '100'
	option limit '150'
	option leasetime '12h' 
EOF
